## Introduction: The Crypto Arbitrage Dream

Imagine a world where you could see the next big trading opportunity before anyone else.  
A world where you donâ€™t just react to the marketâ€”you **predict** it.

Welcome to the cutting edge of crypto trading, where **artificial intelligence** meets **arbitrage**.  
In this post, Iâ€™ll take you on a journey through the real-world challenge of predicting cross-chain arbitrage opportunities using deep learning.  
Weâ€™ll go from the basics to the code, and by the end, youâ€™ll see how AI can help you spot crypto goldmines before the crowd.

## What is Arbitrage?

Arbitrage is one of the oldest tricks in the trading book.  
Itâ€™s simple in theory: **Buy low, sell highâ€”at the same time, in different places.**

In crypto, arbitrage often means exploiting price differences for the same token across different exchanges or blockchains.  
For example:

- On Exchange A, HYPE token is trading at $10.
- On Exchange B, HYPE token is trading at $12.

If you can buy on A and sell on B quickly, you pocket the $2 differenceâ€”minus fees and slippage.

But hereâ€™s the catch:  
**These opportunities are rare, fleeting, and fiercely competitive.**  
By the time you spot them, theyâ€™re often gone.

---

## The Problem: Why Predicting Arbitrage is Hard

Most arbitrageurs are **reactive**. They scan for price differences and jump in when they see one.  
But what if you could be **proactive**â€”predicting the next price spread before it happens?

### The Challenges

- **Market data is noisy and volatile.**  
  Prices jump, volumes spike, and patterns are buried in chaos.

- **Patterns are subtle and non-linear.**  
  Simple rules donâ€™t work. You need something that can learn complex relationships.

- **Opportunities vanish in seconds.**  
  Speed is everything. Prediction gives you a head start.

### The Goal

> **Can we use deep learning to predict the next arbitrage opportunityâ€”before it appears?**

---

## The Data: Turning Market Noise into Signals

To predict arbitrage, we need data. Lots of it.

### What We Collected

- **Price of HYPE on HyperEVM**
- **Price of HYPE on HyperCORE**
- **Amount traded on HyperEVM**
- **Timestamp for every trade**

But raw data isnâ€™t enough. We need to turn it into features that a model can learn from.

### Feature Engineering

We created new features to capture market dynamics:

- **Price Ratio:**  
  \[
  \text{price\_ratio} = \frac{\text{price\_HYPE\_HyperCORE}}{\text{price\_HYPE\_HyperEVM}}
  \]
- **Price Spread (Target):**  
  \[
  \text{delta\_USD} = \text{price\_HYPE\_HyperCORE} - \text{price\_HYPE\_HyperEVM}
  \]
- **Moving Averages:**  
  Short-term trends in price ratio and spread.
- **Momentum:**  
  How fast prices are changing.
- **Volume:**  
  How much is being traded.

### Cleaning and Scaling

- **Clipped outliers** at the 95th percentile (no more wild spikes!)
- **Standardized** all features (mean=0, std=1) so the model learns patterns, not scales.
- **Long sequences** (200 timesteps) to capture market memory.

---

## The Model: LSTM Neural Networks for Time Series

Traditional models (like linear regression) canâ€™t handle the complexity of crypto markets.  
We need something that can learn from **sequences**â€”how the market evolves over time.

### Enter LSTM

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequence data.  
Theyâ€™re used in everything from speech recognition to stock prediction.

**Why LSTM?**

- Remembers long-term dependencies
- Handles noisy, non-linear data
- Proven in financial time series

### Our Architecture

- **3 LSTM layers** (128 hidden units each)
- **Tanh activation** for smooth regression
- **Dropout** for regularization
- **Fully connected output** for the final prediction

**Input:** 200 timesteps of engineered features  
**Output:** The next price spread (`delta_USD`)

---

## Feature Engineering: Less is More

One of the biggest mistakes in machine learning is using too many features.  
We focused on **quality over quantity**:

- Only 9 essential features
- No overfitting, faster training, easier interpretation

**Feature List:**

1. `price_HYPE_HyperEVM`
2. `price_HYPE_HyperCORE`
3. `Amount_HYPE_HyperEVM`
4. `price_ratio`
5. `price_spread`
6. `ma_ratio_3`
7. `ma_delta_3`
8. `price_change`
9. `ratio_change`

---

## Training the Model: From Data to Insight

### Data Preparation

- **Split** data into training (85%) and testing (15%)
- **Create sequences** of 200 timesteps for each sample
- **Clip and scale** targets and features

### Training Loop

- **Loss function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer:** Adam (fast and robust)
- **Learning rate scheduling:** Reduce on plateau
- **Early stopping:** Prevent overfitting

**Sample Training Output:**

```
Training...
Epoch  10/150: Train Loss: 0.012345, Val Loss: 0.013210
Epoch  20/150: Train Loss: 0.011876, Val Loss: 0.012900
...
```

## Results: Can We Really Predict Arbitrage?

After training, we put the model to the test on unseen data.

### Output Format

```
Test Results:
DateTime     Actual($)  Predicted($)  Error($)   Error(%)
05-01 12:00   1.23        1.18         0.05       4.1
05-01 12:05   0.97        1.01         0.04       4.2
...
```

- **Actual($):** The real price spread at that time
- **Predicted($):** What the model thought it would be
- **Error($):** Absolute difference
- **Error(%):** Relative error

### What Did We Learn?

- The model can **anticipate price spreads** with impressive accuracy
- Most predictions are within a few percent of the actual value
- Outliers are rare, thanks to robust preprocessing

- **Automated bots** can use these predictions to execute trades instantly
- **Risk is reduced** by acting only on high-confidence signals

### Real-World Impact

## How You Can Try This Yourself

The best part?  
**You can do this too!**

### The Code

Our code is clean, concise, and easy to use.  
Hereâ€™s a simplified version of the core logic:

```python
# Load and preprocess data
df = predictor.load_data('final_data_task1_swell.csv')

# Train the model
predictor.train(train_val_data, epochs=150, batch_size=16, lr=0.001)

# Evaluate on test set
predictor.evaluate_test_set(df, test_split=0.15)
```

### What You Need

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

### How to Adapt

- Use your own trading data
- Change the sequence length or features
- Plug in different tokens or blockchains
